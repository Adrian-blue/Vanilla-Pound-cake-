There are 7 main steps you'll need to follow to make this Vanilla Pound cake :

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup bundt pan with baking spray.

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter until light and creamy about 3 minutes on medium speed. Gradually add in the granulated sugar and confectioners sugar to the butter.. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 8 minutes on medium speed. Add the egg yolks, one at time and mixing in between until combined, scraping down bowl as needed. Beat in vanilla and almond extract.

3. In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt together three times. Reduce mixer to low. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beating until just combined after each addition. Transfer the batter to a large bowl and clean out your mixer bowl.

4. With the whisk attachment, beat the eggs whites on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten egg whites into the batter.


5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 to 1.5 hours. (Be sure to keep an eye on it as it could bake faster depending on the size of your bundt pan).

6. Let cake cool in pan for at least 10 0 15 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Let cool completely.

7. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.
